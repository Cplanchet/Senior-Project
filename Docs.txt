Design
	The basic design of a chrome extension is a base JSON file that contains information about the program files, permissions, and functionality. The script files are written in JavaScript and html, to start, 
	I created a content script, which is injected into every webpage visited, as well as a popup which is an HTML page than can be viewed when the extension icon is clicked. 
Progress

Week of 10/11/2020:
	The base Manifest.json file was created, it contains basic information such as the extension name, the version of the program, a description, browser action (the extension logo and what pops up when it is clicked), 
	and finally the scripts that execute on webpages visited.
	The popup.html file was added and contains information for what the UI will look like. Currently it only contains a placeholder header field.
	The content.js file is the JavaScript that is injected into webpages. I added a basic script that uses “.getElementByTagName” to get all link tags and store them as an HTML collection. I then console.log all the links to display them in the console.

Week of 10/18/2020:
	The Background File was created, it contains code that should be completed in the background independent of the user or any webpages in the browser. It was initially created as a way to send links back and forth from the 
	extension to the VirusTotal servers. This is accomplished using JavaScript along with an HTML form and the post method.

Week of 10/25/20:
	The Post method in the Background files throws exceptions whenever there is an attempt to throw a URL, this week was spend researching and attempting to repair the error so that the project can continue. The process used to 
	test sending URLs is looking at the console of the background script using chromes extension manager, while sending a simple URL such as to google.com. I will add the functionality of sending URLs from the visited webpage once 
	commination is set up.

Week of 11/1/2020:
	The Post method still did not work after a week so I have decided to pivot and attempt a different method. During my research I have discovered the Put method which acts differently than the Post method. In my Understanding, 
	the Post Method attempts to change variables in PHP that have been set up by the developer prior, while PUT simple places desired strings into the address bar. In this case it is impossible to use POST without first knowing the 
	required Variables to change, so I began changing the code to use PUT.

Week of 11/8/2020:
	The PUT method has successfully placed the strings I give it into the address bar; however, Virus Total does not recognize the URLs I give it. This week I will look deeper into what URLs VirusTotal needs as well as the basic 
	ability for my scripts to communicate with eachother. 
Week of 11/15/2020:
	I implemented a function to convert URLs to their ascii form for special character. I made sure to include the: and / symbols for URLs in addition to other special characters to include other unforeseen cases. The next step is 
	to begin collecting data from virus total to be analyzed and changed.
Week of 11/22/2020:
	The previous function was removed and replaced with the encodeURIComponent function. I also began working on analyzing the Virus Total results which lead me to find that Virus Total has implemented an API that allows for quick 
	and easy communication and analysis. I intent to change the current code in order to utilize this API instead of the raw PUT method. 
Week of 11/29/2020:
	The structure of the project has shifted from an extension that uses a background script to communicate with Virus Total, to an extension that sends URLs to a server which sends and receives data from Virus Total and sends back 
	the response. I have added a Node.js server which for now runs on the local host and waits for a connection to port 8080, upon which it sends an arbitrary link to Virus Total. The next step is to create communication between the 
	Node.js server and the extension, as well as the ability for the extension to send specific links rather than only needing to connect.

Week of 1/17/21:
	This week was spent filling out and submitting an application to Virus Total for the professional version of the API, the application consisted of some personal information to identify who I am, as well as several essay style question 
	concerning my intention for using the API and to what extent I will use it. After submitting the application I got an email claiming that Virus Total has received my application and are considering it.

Week of 1/24/21:	
	This week I worked on sorting through the data send by VirusTotal to create a smaller object that can be sent back to the extensions, I processed the data by taking each company used to detect malware, and check if one of them
	detects malware
Week of 1/31/21:
	This week was a continuation of last week, I sorted throuhg more data.
Week of 2/7/21:
	This week I finished sorting through data and started working on sending an object containing the results back to the extension. In addition to this I also changed the scope of the program as follows: The program will not longer
	attempt to scan every link on the page due to restrictions created by the VirusTotal Basic Api, it will now scan the first link on the page as a proof of concept.
